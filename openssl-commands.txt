# Generate a private key to use
# 	we will use DES3
#	our output file is "cloud-key.pem"
#	we want a key with 4096 bits (2048 is common) 
#
#  ***  DO NOT LOSE YOUR PASSPHRASE  ***
#

openssl genrsa -des3 -out cloud-key.pem 4096 



# In case we don't want the passphrase on the keyfile
#	specify the key we just generated as the "in" file
#	specify the output file that wont have a password
#
#  ***  Remember that passphrase you werent supposed to lose  ***
#  ****  you will need the passphrase here....

openssl rsa -in cloud-key.pem -out cloud-key.pem.nopass



# Create a public key file / extract the public key from the pem
#	pass in the key/pem we created in step one
#	specify the output format you want
#	***  BE SURE TO SPECIFY -pubout  ***
#	(failure to specify -pubout exports the private key)
#	specify the output file for the public key/pem
